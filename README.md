### How to run this code:
1. Install the angular-cli on your machine. Go to cli.angular.io for instructions.
2. Each folder is a angular cli project. To run one you need to cd into the folder and run `npm i`, to install its dependencies, for each project folder you want to run. For example `cd firebootcamp-crm-demo` then `npm i`
3. To run a project cd into the project folder, for example `cd firebootcamp-crm-demo`, and run `ng serve`
